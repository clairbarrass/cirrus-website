title: UK National Open Hackathon 2023
summary: 
---


Open Hackathons are multi-day intensive hands-on events designed to help computational scientists and researchers port and optimize their applications using GPUs. These events pair participants with dedicated mentors experienced in GPU programming and development. Representing distinguished scholars and preeminent institutions around the world, these teams of mentors and attendees work together to realize performance gains and speedups by taking advantage of parallel programming on GPUs. 

## February 27, and March 6-8, 2023

The UK National Open Hackathon partnered with EPSRC, NVIDIA, and OpenACC.org will be designed for teams to work in productive sprint sessions with expert mentors for the duration of the event. A wide variety of different projects are possible, for example:

- Accelerating applications written in common languages - C/C++, Fortran, Python
- Using OpenACC to gradually offload work to GPUs and incrementally improving the performance
- Identifying expensive kernels and porting them to CUDA
- Profiling already GPU accelerated applications to find hotspots for further acceleration

Applications are open now until 16th January 2023
