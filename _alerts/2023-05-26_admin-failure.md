status: Ongoing
type: Service alert
start_date: 2023-05-26 10:00 BST
end_date: 
scope: Slurm scheduler
impact: Slurm commands (e.g. `squeue`, `sbatch`) may not work. Maintenance scheduled for 31 May 2023 will prevent long jobs from starting.
reason: There has been a hardware component failure on a Cirrus administration node. A workaround has been put in place but the service is running at risk until the faulty component can be replaced. Current ETA for replacement component is Wed 31 May 2023.
