type: Service alert
start_date: 2023-05-26 10:00 BST
end_date: 
scope: Slurm scheduler
impact: Slurm commands (e.g. `squeue`, `sbatch`) may not work. Maintenance scheduled for 31 May 2023 will prevent long jobs from starting. 
reason: There has been a hardware component failure on a Cirrus administration node. A workaround has been put in place but the service is running at risk until the faulty component can be replaced. Current ETA for replacement component is Wed 31 May 2023. Update 2023-05-31 1730 BST The replacement for the faulty component has now arrived on site and has been swapped successfully. Our team now need to perform validation tests, remove the workarounds and complete the configuartion. We will provide a further update tomorrow at noon.
