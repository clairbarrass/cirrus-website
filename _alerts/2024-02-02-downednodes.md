status: Ongoing
type: Service Alert
start_date: 2024-02-02 10:15
end_date: 
scope: All jobs
impact: The Cirrus cooling system has failed, and all compute nodes (CPU and GPU) have been shut down. No jobs are able to run and jobs that were running at the time should be automatically refunded. Users may still access the login nodes, access their data and submit jobs. The short QoS will not work. Queued work will queue until the compute nodes are returned. The hardware vendor is coming onsite to repair Cirrus on Monday and we will issue a further update then.
