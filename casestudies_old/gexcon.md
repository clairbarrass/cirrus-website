summary: A unique explosion and fire-modelling service for process-manufacturing industries. 
---

FLACS-as-a-service offers a unique explosion and fire-modelling service on the Cirrus HPC platform. 
Used in the oil, gas and process industries, the tool can model the consequences of dispersion, explosion 
and fire, helping to improve safety.   

Gexcon AS is a world-leading company in the field of safety and risk management and advanced dispersion, 
explosion and fire modelling. It provides a range of services including consultancy, training and research 
and development, as well as providing the FLACS CFD code for modelling explosions and atmospheric dispersions.

Gexcon has developed a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) explosion and fire modelling software product called FLACS. 
FLACS is a highly regarded tool for modelling flammable and toxic releases in a technical safety context and it is used 
extensively by Gexcon on customer consultancy projects.  

Gexcon UK can use FLACS on its local computational platforms, but it can be beneficial to run the code in 
high-performance computing (HPC) environments such as Cirrus instead as this drastically reduces the overall simulation 
time. The Cirrus cluster is ideally suited to run multiple FLACS simulations simultaneously. Short individual simulations 
(each typically takes up to a few hours’ computing time) can be processed efficiently and several hundred can be processed 
in a matter of days.   

Gexcon and EPCC collaborated to develop a unique explosion and fire modelling-service on the Cirrus HPC platform. 
The service will have wide applicability across the petrochemical, nuclear and general process manufacturing industries 
with users benefiting from a significant reduction in simulation times.   

GexCon has gained the advantages of HPC, such as delivering results faster to its customers, without the need to 
invest in large-scale HPC infrastructure.    

Following on from the successful implementation of FLACS on Cirrus, Gexcon and EPCC collaborated to develop 
FLACS-as-a-service on the Cirrus HPC platform. The service will have wide applicability across the petrochemical, 
nuclear and general process manufacturing industries with users benefiting from easy, cost-effective access to FLACS 
which can reduce simulation times from weeks to a matter of hours.  

The new service will be instrumental in driving impact from EPSRC’s investment in the Cirrus platform.
