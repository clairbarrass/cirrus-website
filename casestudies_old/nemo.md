title: NEMO into container technology
summary: EPCC is working with NOC to help widen the number of researchers who are able to develop and run NEMO
---

NEMO (Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean) is a large & complex numerical model used by physical oceanographers 
at a relatively small number of large research centres across Europe. Given the difficulties in compiling it on different 
machines, we are packaging NEMO into a Singularity container, so that itâ€™s easier for researchers and HPC administrators 
to develop, test, and run NEMO at their home institutions.  Singularity is currently installed on Cirrus, and EPCC already 
has knowledge about running containers in an HPC environment, so this is a good opportunity for the oceanographic community 
to use the expertise at EPCC to help expand the accessibility of NEMO to a wider range of researchers.


* More straightforward installation of NEMO
* Easier to test NEMO locally before deploying to a cluster
* Increase number of users of NEMO
* Decrease barrier of entry to running and developing NEMO
* Widen knowledge about emerging technologies to an increasing number of scientific domains
