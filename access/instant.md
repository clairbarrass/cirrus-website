Apply for Instant Access to Cirrus
==================================

As a pump priming opportunity for new users, Cirrus offers instant
access to Cirrus for a limited number of Core-h over a six month period.
This mode of access should give new users the opportunity to test Cirrus
for their purposes and work towards a fully peer reviewed application,
either via a [standard grant](grant.html) or via
[Access to HPC calls](access-to-hpc). An extension will only be granted
in exceptional cases.

**Note:** Only one Instant Access project is available to each person.

Application Proceedure
----------------------

You can apply for a maximum of 20,000 Core-h or 800 GPU-h over a six month period to test
the Cirrus service for your work.

A [Cirrus Instant Access Technical Assessment Form](ta/Cirrus-TA-Instant-form.docx)
should be completed by you and sent to the [Cirrus Helpdesk](/support/).

The Cirrus CSE service will evaluate the technical feasibility of the project.

These short projects are not evaluated further, unless an extension is required.
