summary: Adding Cirrus access to research grants
---

Access through EPSRC grants
===========================

On J-eS, access can be requested by including Cirrus costs on a
standard EPSRC grant application.

A completed
[Grant/Open Access Technical Assessment (TA)](ta/Cirrus-TA-RAPGrant-form.docx) must be uploaded
along with the application as a supporting document. 

Cirrus should be added to EPSRC Je-S applications in the following way 

1. Go to the "Research Council Facilities" section 
2. Select the facility "Other" from the drop down menu, use "Cirrus (Tier-2 HPC)" as the name of the facility in the "Proposed Usage box" 
3.The "Units" text box should contain the number of Core-h you are requesting along with the unit specifier, e.g. "20000 Core-h" 
4. The notional cost of access to the facility should be included in the access costs text box. (This is the number you calculate from your Core-h number and the cost per Core-h.) 

**Cost of access to Cirrus is still being finalised, if you wish to
include Cirrus on an EPSRC grant then please contact the
[Cirrus Helpdesk](/support/).**

Access through other grant-awarding bodies
==========================================

Cirrus costs can be included in applications from other grant awarding
bodies.

You should complete a  [Grant/Open Access Technical Assessment (TA)](ta/Cirrus-TA-RAPGrant-form.docx)  form and
send to the [Cirrus Helpdesk](/support/) ahead of your proposal 
submission. The completed TA form can then be included along with your
application as required.

**Cost of access to Cirrus is still being finalised, if you wish to
include Cirrus on a grant application then please contact the
[Cirrus Helpdesk](/support/).**

Resource Avaiable
==========================================  

We would normally expect Grant Access applications to be around 500,000 - 2,000,000 Core-h per annum but we do have larger projects than this. Please contact the [Cirrus Helpdesk](/support/) to discuss if you have larger requirements.
