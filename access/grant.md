Access through EPSRC grants
===========================

You can include Cirrus on EPSRC funding applications when you are applying for funding (if you already have an active grant then you should consider applying via one of the calls for Cirrus time only that are described
on our [Access page](../access/).

When submitting proposals to EPSRC Standard Mode (Grant) that include Cirrus resources on the UKRI Funding Service, you should add Cirrus  under Section 6: Facilities

- facility name: Cirrus
- usage: the requested resource in Core-h and/or GPUh as *[unit](../access/#resource-units)* and the [notional cost](#notional-costs) in £ as *cost*. Reasonable Cirrus allocations are
now awarded for the duration of the EPSRC funding. 
- confirmation of facility agreement: This is a completed [Technical Assessment Form](https://www.cirrus.ac.uk/access/ta/Cirrus-TA-Grant-form.docx)   prior to submission.  Should an application be funded then grant funding would not be released until EPSRC have had sight of the relevant TA, as provided by the facility. 






Access through other grant-awarding bodies
==========================================

Cirrus [costs](#notional-costs) can be included in applications from other grant awarding
bodies.

You should complete a  [Grant/Open Access Technical Assessment (TA)](ta/Cirrus-TA-Grant-form.docx)  form and
send to the [Cirrus Helpdesk](/support/) ahead of your proposal 
submission. The completed TA form can then be included along with your
application as required.



Resource Available
==========================================  

We would normally expect Grant Access applications to be around 500,000 - 2,000,000 Core-h per annum but we do have larger projects than this. Please contact the [Cirrus Helpdesk](/support/) to discuss if you have larger requirements.


Notional Costs
==============

## CPU Cost

Cirrus cost for EPSRC Grant proposals : £0.0092 per Core-h ( 1 node hour is 36 * 0.0092  =  £0.3312  )

Cirrus cost for ANY non-EPSRC Grant including EU proposals : £0.02 per Core-h (1 node hour is 36 * 0.02  =  £0.72)

## GPU Cost

Cirrus cost for EPSRC Grant proposals : £0.2574 per GPUh 

Cirrus cost for ANY non-EPSRC Grant including EU proposals : £1.0178 per GPUh
