## Known Issues 

We are experiening a heavy load on the metadata server. Our systems team are investigating but we suspect this is due to user(s) performing many I/O operations. We apologise for the inconvenience this is causing users.

## Module Updates 

Module Update following Cirrus Upgrade September 2022 
  
| Description | Reason | Advice |
| ---    | ---  | ---   | 
| Removed Molpro module and user doc section | No longer functional | No longer centrally supported on Cirrus |
| Forge to be updated	| v20.0.3 found to have security flaw | Pending. Newer version will be installed as a replacement. |
| Updated mpi4py | All the mpi4py modules are tied to a particular version of python, 3.8.12. More flexibility is required such that users can run python-based parallel code using different python versions. | The mpi4py modules have been replaced by a suite of python modules: python/3.8.13, python/3.8.13-gpu, python/3.9.12, and python/3.9.12-gpu. The gpu modules load a miniconda3 python environment containing mpi4py 3.1.3 linked with OpenMPI 4.1.x and CUDA 11.6; whereas the cpu modules (no -gpu suffix) load a python environment containing mpi4py 3.1.3 linked with HPE MPT 2.25. (The python/3.8.13-gpu module is linked with OpenMPI 4.1.2 and the python/3.9.12-gpu module is linked with OpenMPI 4.1.4.)Â |
| Updated horovod | Updated | Module version 0.24.2-gpu has been replaced by 0.25.0-gpu. |
| Updated pytorch | Updated | Module version 1.11.0-gpu has been replaced by 1.12.0-gpu. |
| Updated tensorflow | Updated | Module version 2.8.0-gpu has been replaced by 2.9.1-gpu. |
| Updated scalasca	| Version 2.5 no longer functional. | Please use 2.6-gcc8-mpt225 or 2.6-intel19-mpt225 instead. |
| Removed spack/2020 module | Not used. | Not required. Please contact the service desk if Spack installation is needed. |
| Updated tmux | Version 3.1b no longer functional. | Version 3.3a provided as replacement. |


## At Risk Maintenance Sessions

There is an 'At-Risk' Session provisionally booked every Wednesday from 1000 - 1200. 
A user mailing will be sent if any work is going to take place which may impact users.

### Service Calendar

We maintain a calendar for the Cirrus service that lists upcoming events (such
as training courses and maintenance sessions):

- [Cirrus Service Calendar](calendar.html)

We keep maintenance downtime to a minimum on the service but do occaisionally
need to perform essential work on the system. Maintenance sessions are used to 
ensure that:

* software versions are kept up to date;
* firmware levels on HPE and third-party peripheral equipment are kept up to date;
essential security patches are applied;
* failed/suspect hardware can be replaced;
* new software can be installed;
periodic essential maintenance on HPE electrical and mechanical support equipment (refrigeration systems, air blowers and power distribution units) can be undertaken safely.

Additional maintenance sessions can be scheduled for major hardware or software updates; major upgrades to facility plant and infrastructure; acceptance testing following major service upgrades and statutory electrical testing.
