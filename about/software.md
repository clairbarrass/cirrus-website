The Cirrus Service includes a number of centrally installed scientific software
packages maintained by EPCC staff and other experts.

A list of this software with details of how to access it and run jobs (including
example job submission scripts) is available in the online documentation, see:

* [Cirrus Online Documentation](http://docs.cirrus.ac.uk)

We also record instructions for compiling many packages on Cirrus that users may
find useful in a GitHub repository, see:

* [GitHub: Package Build Instructions](https://github.com/hpc-uk/build-instructions)

Application Development Environment
-----------------------------------

The application development environment includes a number of different compilers,
parallel programming models, numerical/IO libraries, debuggers and profiling tools.
In short:

* Compilers - GNU, Intel
* Parallel Programming Models - MPI, OpenMP
* Libraries - BLAS, LAPACK, BLACS, ScaLAPACK, FFTW, and more

For more information see the [Cirrus Online Documentation](http://docs.cirrus.ac.uk).
